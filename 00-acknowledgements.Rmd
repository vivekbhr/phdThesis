This thesis would not be complete without the help and support of people from both the Akhtar Lab and Manke group at the MPI-IE. I am grateful to both my supervisors Dr. Asifa Akhtar and Dr. Thomas Manke for trusting my abilities and allowing me to work with them. Asifa provided me with all the independence I desired to work on my projects and to collaborate with the people in the lab. Discussions with her provided me the motivation and ability to see the significance of the work I was doing. Thomas has always been available for me to discuss all sorts of issues and provided me with the support and encouragement I needed to improve my skills and prepare for the next steps in my career. Opting for this co-supervision was the best choice I could have made for my PhD.

All of my works presented here have been done in collaboration, and would not be completed without the efforts and insights of those involved. I would like to thank :

Fidel, who taught me HiC analysis and mentored me during our collaboration on the HiC project. Due to HiCExplorer and deepTools projects, I was pushed out of my comfort zone to learn Python and to adopt reproducible workflows for my analysis. I glady cherish all the discussions with Fidel during work as well as during our Sunday morning run. Giuseppe, for initiating the wonderful collaborations on the Drosophila projects, and for all the helpful discussions over the years. Raed, for working with me on the mammalian MSL2 project. Ibrahim and Tugce for initiating the collaboration on the mammalian MLE project, and finally Bilal and Ken for other independent projects. I would like to thank all the people at the Bioinformatics Unit for providing me with such a wonderful and interactive working environment, useful discussions, and fun collaborations. The deep-sequencing unit for producing the great quality data, and people in the Akhtar lab for all the discussions as well as fun activities outside work. Finally I want to thank my TAC members Ritwick Sawarkar and Michael Stadler for the support and discussions during my TAC.
