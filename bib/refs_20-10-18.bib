              methodology used to investigate chromatin-based regulation in
              biological systems such as human disease, but the lack of an
              empirical methodology to enable normalization among experiments
              has limited the precision and usefulness of this technique. Here,
              we describe a method called ChIP with reference exogenous genome
              (ChIP-Rx) that allows one to perform genome-wide quantitative
              comparisons of histone modification status across cell
              populations using defined quantities of a reference epigenome.
              ChIP-Rx enables the discovery and quantification of dynamic
              epigenomic profiles across mammalian cells that would otherwise
              remain hidden using traditional normalization methods. We
              demonstrate the utility of this method for measuring epigenomic
              changes following chemical perturbations and show how reference

              for differences in sex chromosome dose by hypertranscribing the
              single X chromosome in males. However, there is an approximately
              1 hour delay between the onset of zygotic transcription and the
              establishment of canonical dosage compensation near the end of
              mitotic cycle 14. During this time, zygotic transcription drives
              segmentation, cellularization, and other important developmental
              events. Since many of the genes involved in these processes are
              on the X chromosome, we wondered whether they are transcribed at
              higher levels in females and whether this might lead to
              sex-specific early embryonic patterning. To investigate this

              14, using polymorphisms between parental lines to distinguish
              maternal and zygotic transcription. We found limited sex-specific
              zygotic transcription, with a weak tendency for genes on the X to
              be expressed at higher levels in females. However, transcripts

              to the activation of the canonical MSL-mediated dosage

              dosage compensation results in nearly identical transcript levels

              associating domains (TADs), the role of genetic information in
              TAD formation is still not fully understood. Here we use our
              software, HiCExplorer (hicexplorer.readthedocs.io) to annotate
              >2800 high-resolution (570 bp) TAD boundaries in Drosophila
              melanogaster. We identify eight DNA motifs enriched at
              boundaries, including a motif bound by the M1BP protein, and two
              new boundary motifs. In contrast to mammals, the CTCF motif is
              only enriched on a small fraction of boundaries flanking inactive
              chromatin while most active boundaries contain the motifs bound
              by the M1BP or Beaf-32 proteins. We demonstrate that boundaries
              can be accurately predicted using only the motif sequences at
              open chromatin sites. We propose that DNA sequence guides the
              genome architecture by allocation of boundary proteins in the
              genome. Finally, we present an interactive online database to
              access and explore the spatial organization of fly, mouse and
              human genomes, available at http://chorogenome.ie-freiburg.mpg.de

              facilitate de novo repeat identification without the need for
              reference databases of known elements. Because the algorithm uses

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: ChIP-seq has become an important tool for identifying
              genome-wide protein-DNA interactions, including transcription
              factor binding and histone modifications. In ChIP-seq
              experiments, ChIP samples are usually coupled with their matching
              control samples. Proper normalization between the ChIP and
              control samples is an essential aspect of ChIP-seq data analysis.
              RESULTS: We have developed a novel method for estimating the
              normalization factor between the ChIP and the control samples.
              Our method, named as NCIS (Normalization of ChIP-seq) can
              accommodate both low and high sequencing depth datasets. We
              compare statistical properties of NCIS against existing methods
              in a set of diverse simulation settings, where NCIS enjoys the
              best estimation precision. In addition, we illustrate the impact
              of the normalization factor in FDR control and show that NCIS
              leads to more power among methods that control FDR at nominal
              levels. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the proper
              normalization between the ChIP and control samples is an
              important step in ChIP-seq analysis in terms of power and error
              rate control. Our proposed method shows excellent statistical

              interactions but the molecular mechanisms that govern specificity
              have remained elusive. Genome-wide studies utilizing STARR-seq
              identified two enhancer classes in Drosophila that interact with
              different core promoters: housekeeping enhancers (hkCP) and
              developmental enhancers (dCP). We hypothesized that the two
              enhancer classes are occupied by distinct architectural proteins,
              affecting their enhancer-promoter contacts. By evaluating
              ChIP-seq occupancy of architectural proteins, typical
              enhancer-associated proteins, and histone modifications, we
              determine that both enhancer classes are enriched for RNA
              Polymerase II, CBP, and architectural proteins but there are also
              distinctions. hkCP enhancers contain H3K4me3 and exclusively bind
              Cap-H2, Chromator, DREF and Z4, whereas dCP enhancers contain
              H3K4me1 and are more enriched for Rad21 and Fs(1)h-L.

              that hkCP enhancers are more likely to form multi-TSS interaction

              (TAD) borders, while dCP enhancers are more often bound to one or
              two TSSs and are enriched at chromatin loop anchors. The data
              support a model suggesting that the unique architectural protein
